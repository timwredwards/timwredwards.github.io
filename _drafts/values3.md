Rejig these around:

Positivity and kindness

Learning and training
We are so privileged to be in this position
We owe it to ourselves and society to keep learning, so we can give back to the community. Both as individuals and as a team.

Honesty and integrity
Be honest with each other, tell people what you think.
Be constructive but true.
Don't lie to one another, or to yourself.

Respect and Inclusivity
Mobile devs think they are special
All engineers are solving the same problems, important to respect and communicate others
Technology has the unique ability to genuinely improve society for the better, and although there have been questionable decisions made thus far, I believe we can do better.
Not burning out

Community and sustainability
