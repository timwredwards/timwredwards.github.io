Hello! I'm Tim, an iOS Engineer from the UK.

I've been making apps since 2012, when I first learned Objective-C at university.

Since then, I've worked with a myriad of companies in both the UK and internationally and had the opportunity to develop apps supporting millions of users.

Over the years, I've gained the skills and experience to critically analyse existing codebases, understand their pain-points and design & develop actionable plans for improvement.

I understand SOLID principles within the iOS ecosystem, and how test-driven development, intelligent system architecture, and agile-methodologies can mitigate bugs, improve code quality and make your app a success.

For any enquires, please use [this form](/contact).

Thanks for visiting!

Tim
