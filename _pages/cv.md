- Undertook an architectural research project, including the introduction of a new SQLite-based persistence layer.
- Developed and integrated the new "checkbox" task completion animations and UI navigation paths.
- Migrated the Todoist iOS codebase to Swift 4.2, and implemented general bug fixes & performance improvements.

Depop is a community-driven marketplace with over 8 million registered users, and a mobile-first strategy with over 75% of sales coming from iOS users alone. This means extreme emphasis is placed on keeping crash-rates low, and providing a top-quality experience for the end user. I worked as a Senior Engineer at Depop and successfully:
- Developed the user video feature, including the capture, post-processing, upload and consumption of all video content in the app. This feature was released stable and on time, providing a lot of value for our users.
- Refactored many legacy Objective-C classes to Swift VIPER modules, using TDD to mitigate regressions.
- Hosted sprint planning and retrospective meetings with other engineers and project stakeholders.
- On-boarded and trained junior team members, including pair programming and white-boarding sessions.
