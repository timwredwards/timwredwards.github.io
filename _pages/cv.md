<!-- BIO -->
<p class="bio">
 An accomplished engineer, with over five years experience building and scaling iOS applications in both start-up and corporate environments. As a Swift user since it's inception, I understand SOLID principles within iOS, and how test-driven development, smart architecture design, and agile methodologies can mitigate bugs, improve code quality and make your app a success.

Delivery Hero (DH) is a food delivery and logistics company operating in 42 countries, with over 500,000 restaurants globally, with over 660m orders made last year. I work in the Financial Technologies (FinTech) department of DH, where I'm responsible for the development of the iOS Consumer Wallet framework, enabling users to quickly get refunded for orders and store credit for later use. While at DH I have:
- Introduced unit-testing to the Wallet framework, achieving ~60% code coverage and improving application stability.
- Overhauled test-automation scripting using Google's Earl Gray UI testing framework.
- Updated locale handling to support country-specific images and assets, enabling the Wallet to launch in three new countries.
- Communicated estimates, technical specifications and limitations with scrum masters and PM's.
- Held architectural discussions regarding the future of the Wallet framework, and it's dependencies.

Hibooks is an audiobook service provider. Their iOS application includes an offline-playback feature, and the ability to purchase new books using in-app purchases. I worked for Hibooks as a Senior iOS Engineer, where I successfully:

- Wrote an extensive UI testing suite, as the existing codebase was too tightly coupled for traditional unit tests. This gave the team confidence in making architectural changes, and enabled refactors of code sections previously considered too fragile.

- Designed and implemented architectural improvements throughout all layers of the application, most notably the UI layer, including a switch from MVC to MVVM. This decoupling improved overall code health and made unit-testing possible.

- Introduced BDD within the Product team, and created detailed behavioural specifications from which unit-tests were written using the Nimble iOS framework. This consolidated team knowledge, improved internal communication and app stability.

- Performed codebase clean-up and health improvements using static-analysis and linting tools, such as Periphery, SwiftLint, and custom scripting. This improved code readability and reduced compile times by removing many unreferenced symbols.

- Researched and documented communication guidelines for asynchronous communication across timezones, and wrote automated scripts for many developer processes, resulting in a notable improvement to cross-office efficiency.

- Worked closely with the CRM team, introducing behavioural analytics frameworks and A / B testing, providing the data necessary for project stakeholders to make intelligent business decisions.

Todoist is a task manager and collaboration tool for mobile and web platforms, with millions of users and over 1 billion tasks completed to date. I worked as a remote contractor on the iOS project, where I successfully:

- Undertook an architectural research project, including the introduction of a new SQLite-based persistence layer.

- Developed and integrated the new "check-box" task completion animations and UI navigation paths.

- Migrated the Todoist iOS codebase to Swift 4.2, and implemented general bug fixes & performance improvements.

Depop is a community-driven marketplace with over 8 million registered users, and a mobile-first strategy with over 75% of sales coming from iOS users. I worked as an iOS Senior Engineer at Depop and successfully:

- Developed the user video feature, including the capture, post-processing, upload and consumption of all video content in the app. This feature was released stable and on time, providing a lot of value to users, and is now an integral part of the app.

- Refactored many legacy Objective-C classes to Swift VIPER modules, using TDD to mitigate regressions.

- Overhauled the CI workflow using Fastlane and Bitrise, including auto-deployment to TestFlight users and the App Store.

- Hosted sprint planning and retrospective meetings with other engineers and project stakeholders.

- On-boarded and trained junior team members, including pair programming and white-boarding sessions.
