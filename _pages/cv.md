A talented engineer with over 5 years industry experience delivering robust and extensible apps. As a Swift user from day zero, I understand SOLID principles within iOS, and how tools such as test-driven development, agile-methodologies and architectural design can mitigate bugs, improve code quality and make your app a success.

Todoist is a task manager and collaboration tool for mobile and web platforms, with millions of users and over 1 billion tasks completed to date. I briefly worked as a remote contractor on the iOS project, where I successfully:
- Undertook an architectural research project, including the introduction of a new SQLite-based persistence layer.
- Developed and integrated the new "checkbox" task completion animations and UI navigation paths.
- Migrated the Todoist iOS codebase to Swift 4.2, and implemented general bug fixes & performance improvements.

### Depop
<div class="details" markdown="1">
> "The creative community's mobile marketplace"

**London, UK • July 2017 - February 2018**
</div>
Depop is a community-driven marketplace with over 8 million registered users, and a mobile-first strategy with over 75% of sales coming from iOS users alone. This means extreme emphasis is placed on keeping crash-rates low, and providing a top-quality experience for the end user. I worked as a Senior Engineer at Depop and successfully:
- Developed the user video feature, including the capture, post-processing, upload and consumption of all video content in the app. This feature was released stable and on time, providing a lot of value for our users.
- Refactored many legacy Objective-C classes to Swift VIPER modules, using TDD to mitigate regressions.
- Hosted sprint planning and retrospective meetings with other engineers and project stakeholders.
- On-boarded and trained junior team members, including pair programming and white-boarding sessions.

> "Home security without the hassle"

**Leeds, UK • February 2016 - July 2017**

Cocoon designed home-security hardware and mobile apps to alert users. As one of two members of the iOS team I:
- Retroactively implemented unit-testing, facilitating the safe introduction of new features including Core Location services, remote logging, APNS, and the beginning of a refactor from the legacy Objective-C codebase to Swift.
- Integrated an HTTP live video streaming client using libVLC, which was applauded for its quick performance.
- Modernised the continuous integration system to utilise Fastlane and Travis CI, for auto-deployment to Testflight.
