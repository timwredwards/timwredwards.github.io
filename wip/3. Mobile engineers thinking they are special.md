# Mobile engineers thinking they are special
- iOS and android both think their os is better
- Same as Mac vs Windows vs Linux, console vs pc gamers.
- I've worked in companies where the front-end teams literally never talked to each other.
- Worse still, when it's engineering vs everyone else.
- Why is this bad
- Frameworks are both opaque and have restrictions, not a bad thing in terms of security but indirectly encourages tribal behaviour, this also comes across to engineering.
- A lot of engineers, especially juniors don't understand the social dynamics of a comapny, and that you're a team. In a company with a healthy culture, if your collegeues succeed, you succeed.
- Writing business logic twice or three times sucks but is sometimes required. There's no convincable cross-platform solution yet. React-native sucks, writing c++ libraries sucks, hosting a local web server is slow and introduces threading issues. There is talk of kotlin cross-platform frameworks but this is still in it's early stages.
- Even with a thin client based stack, this has it's disadvantages, mostly speed. And there will always be cross-platform code.
- Writing cross-platform use-cases and behavioural / unit tests is possible and useful. The ios, android and web teams should be working closely to sync-up their business logic so if bugs arise, tests can be added to all platforms and everyone benefits.
- Bugs come up earlier
- Tests are written
- Entire stack becomes more robust
- Centralized knowlwedge is reduced, meaning if someone leaves it's less of a biggie
- Also, it's easier for everyone to understand the environment of a problem.
- Also, shared terminology is good for comms.
