# iOS ARCHITECTURE IN 2020
- MVC + cocoabindings
- Why MVC worked at the time
- Why MVC doesn't work now
- MVP, an improvement
- MVP, kitchen sink syndrome
- MVVM, also kitchen sink syndrome
- MVVM and RxSwift, better but hard to debug, and who wants dependencies? (link to dependency reduction)
- VIPER for separation of concerns, but some problems.
- VIP for unidirectional data, same problems as VIPER
- SwiftUI + Combine, back to MVVM. Bindings solve the source-of-truth problem.
- I would not use Combine now, I would switch to RxSwift until iOS 13 is adopted.
